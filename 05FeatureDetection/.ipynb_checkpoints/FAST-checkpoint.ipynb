    "## FAST(Features from Accelerated Segment Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of FAST algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "1. For one pixel $p$ in the image, let its intensity be $I_p$.\n",
    "2. Seletct an appropriate threshold value $t$.\n",
    "3. Consider a circle of 16 pixels around the pixel under test:<br>\n",
    "  ![image](./ipyimg/FAST.jpg)\n",
    "4. We say the pixel under test is a corner if there are 12 continuous pixels(in the 16 pixels) which are all brighter than $I_p+t$ or all darker than $I_p-t$.\n",
    "5. Actually, to speed up, we just check the pixels at 1, 5, 9, 13. We first check 1, 9 and then 5, 13. If there are 3 pixels darker than the dark-threshold or brighter than the bright-threshold, we see it as a corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are definately many drawbacks of this method. So we use Machine Learning methods(superivison learning) and None-Maximal Supression to impove the accuracy, especially detect the images with same distribution.\n",
    "1. Select a set of images as training set.\n",
    "2. Run FAST in every training image to find feature points.\n",
    "3. Let the 16 piexels of very detected featured points as feature vector $P$.\n",
    "4. Define a label $K_p$, which is true if $p$ is a corner and false otherwise.\n",
    "5. Use ID3 algorithm (decision tree classifier) to train a model with the input data as feature vector $P$ and input label as $K_p$, measured by the entropy of $K_p$\n",
    "6. Recursively train util entropy is zero.\n",
    "7. Consider a score function V, which is teh sum of absolute difference between $p$ asnd 16 surrounding pixels values.\n",
    "8. Consider the adjacent feature points, One will be discarded if one adjacent feature point has a higher score."
